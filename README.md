# Homelab Dashboard

Local-network dashboard for monitoring Proxmox hosts with auto-discovered LXCs/VMs, historical graphs, and ntfy alerting.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (Ubuntu 24: `apt install nodejs npm`)
- Network reachability from this host to every Proxmox node on API port 8006 (HTTPS)

## Install

```bash
git clone <this-repo> /opt/homelab-monitoring
cd /opt/homelab-monitoring
npm install
```

## Create a read-only Proxmox API token

For each Proxmox host you want to monitor:

1. Log into the Proxmox web UI as root.
2. **Datacenter → Permissions → Users → Add** — realm `pve`, user `dashboard`. Submit.
3. **Datacenter → Permissions → API Tokens → Add** — user `dashboard@pve`, token ID `readonly`, **uncheck "Privilege Separation"**. Submit.
4. **Copy the secret** shown in the popup — you will only see it once.
5. **Datacenter → Permissions → Add → User Permission** — path `/`, user `dashboard@pve`, role `PVEAuditor`, propagate checked.

The token's full ID is `dashboard@pve!readonly` and goes in `config.js` as `tokenId`, paired with the secret in `tokenSecret`.

## Configure

Edit `config.js`. Replace every `REPLACE_ME` with actual values:

- `machines[].host` — IP address of the machine
- `machines[].tokenSecret` — Proxmox API token secret (Proxmox entries only)
- `machines[].primaryUrl` — optional; makes the machine card name a clickable link to the web UI
- `guestLinks[]` — optional; overlay a URL + icon onto an auto-discovered LXC/VM so its row becomes clickable

The `name` field on each `machines[]` entry must match the **Proxmox node hostname** exactly (visible in the Proxmox UI under Datacenter → Summary). For `guestLinks`, the `guest` field must match the LXC/VM name in Proxmox.

**Guests are auto-discovered.** Every LXC and VM on your Proxmox hosts appears in the dashboard with live stats — no config needed. You only add `guestLinks` entries for guests you want to make clickable.

## Run

```bash
node server.js
```

Open `http://<this-host>:3000/` in a browser.

Test: `npm test` runs the unit tests for the Proxmox parser, poller, storage, and alerts.

## systemd service

```bash
sudo cp homelab-dashboard.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo useradd --system --home /opt/homelab-monitoring --shell /usr/sbin/nologin dashboard
sudo chown -R dashboard:dashboard /opt/homelab-monitoring
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now homelab-dashboard
sudo systemctl status homelab-dashboard
```

Logs: `journalctl -u homelab-dashboard -f`

## Service icons

Drop SVG files into `public/icons/` matching the `icon` filenames in `guestLinks[]` (e.g. `plex-light.svg`). Missing files fall back to a 3-character text label derived from the guest name. Browse `selfh.st/icons/` for an open-source icon pack covering most self-hosted services.

## Historical graphs

Every poll persists CPU / memory / disk / network for every machine **and** every auto-discovered guest into a local SQLite file at `data/dashboard.db`. Click the graph button on any machine card or guest row to open a chart modal with a range picker (1h / 24h / 7d / 30d), overlaid CPU, memory, rx, and tx lines, and drag-to-zoom.

Retention is tiered to keep disk use bounded:

| Tier | Resolution | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Hot | 10s | 24 hours |
| Warm | 1 minute | 7 days |
| Cold | 10 minutes | 30 days |

A background rollup runs every 5 minutes: data aging out of a tier is averaged into the next tier, then the previous tier is pruned. Expected steady-state disk footprint is roughly **60 MB for 25 entities**, scaling linearly (~100 MB at 40, ~150 MB at 60).

`data/` is in `.gitignore` and backed by SQLite WAL — safe across restarts, no migration needed when the schema is unchanged.

## Alerting (ntfy)

Push notifications to an [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) topic when a rule fires or resolves. Add an `alerts` block to `config.js`:

```js
alerts: {
  ntfy: {
    url: "https://ntfy.sh/your-private-topic",
    firingPriority: "high",
    resolvedPriority: "default",
    firingTags: ["warning"],
    resolvedTags: ["white_check_mark"],
  },
  defaults: {
    cpuPct: 90,
    memPct: 90,
    diskPct: 90,
    forMs: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    reachability: true,
  },
  overrides: [
    { machine: "proxmox-internal", guest: "plex-lxc", cpuPct: 95 },
  ],
},
```

A threshold must hold continuously for `forMs` before firing. Reachability (scrape failure / machine down) fires immediately. One notification on fire, one on resolve — no re-notify. Events persist to SQLite (`alert_events` table, keeps last 1000 rows or 90 days) and render in the dashboard's **Alerts** section (active list + collapsible history). Omit the `alerts` block entirely to disable.

## Known limitations

- **QEMU VM disk usage** reports as `0 B / 0 B` unless `qemu-guest-agent` is installed inside the guest. LXC containers report correctly.
- **First poll after startup** shows `—` for network rates and node_exporter CPU% because rate calculation needs two samples.
- **No authentication** — deploy only on an internal network.
- **HTTP only** — no TLS termination; put it behind a reverse proxy if you need HTTPS.
- **uPlot is loaded from a CDN** on first chart open (jsDelivr). The dashboard runs fine without internet, but clicking a chart button on an offline host will show a load error.

## Architecture

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-homelab-dashboard-design.md` for the design document.

- `server.js` — Express wiring, config validation, routes, storage, rollup job
- `lib/poller.js` — interval loop, in-memory cache, rate calculation, error isolation, persistence
- `lib/storage.js` — SQLite time-series store with tiered retention
- `lib/proxmox.js` — Proxmox API client (`/cluster/resources` + `/nodes/<name>/status`)
- `lib/node_exporter.js` — Prometheus text parser + HTTP fetch
- `public/index.html` — self-contained frontend (Dracula palette, JetBrains Mono, Rajdhani, uPlot modal)
